# 🚀 DevOps Documentation (My Learning Journey)

Welcome to my DevOps learning repository!

Here I’ll be documenting DevOps concepts in **simple English** — with real-life examples.

### 🧩 What is DevOps?

DevOps is a **bridge between Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops)**.
A developer builds an application — for example, **Hotstar** — but they build it on their own laptop.
DevOps is the process that takes Hotstar from the developer’s laptop all the way to **your mobile phone**, so millions of users can use it smoothly.

### 📌 Real Example

Earlier, **ChatGPT** used to show errors like “server overloaded.”
Now it rarely happens because **DevOps teams have scaled the system** to support millions of users.

### ❗ Important

DevOps is **not** a tool you download.
DevOps is a **culture**, a **mindset**, and a way of working where Dev and Ops teams work together from start to finish.
