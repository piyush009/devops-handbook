# 🚀 DevOps Notes (My Learning Journey)

Welcome to my DevOps documentation repository!

This repo contains my DevOps learning notes explained in simple English. I cover how applications move from a developer’s laptop to real users, how systems scale, and how Dev and Ops work together as one team.
My goal is to simplify DevOps concepts and make them easy for anyone to understand.

I will **keep updating this README** with links to all topics as we progress.

## 📚 Topics I’ll Document

* What is DevOps?
* DevOps culture and mindset
* CI/CD basics
* Version control
* Containers & Docker
* Kubernetes fundamentals
* Cloud basics
* Monitoring & logging
* Infrastructure as Code
* Automation tools
* Real-world scenarios

## ✨ Purpose

To explain DevOps in the simplest possible way so learners can understand the “why” behind every concept — not just the tools.
